**sboljs3** is a library for the Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL) written in TypeScript, for JavaScript/TypeScript applications in the browser or node.js. 

sboljs3 is built on [rdfoo](https://github.com/udp/rdfoo), a library for creating object oriented RDF abstractions in TypeScript.  It can therefore be used in conjunction with other rdfoo abstractions.  For example, the PROV-O abstraction used by sboljs3 is provided by [rdfoo-prov](https://github.com/udp/rdfoo-prov).
